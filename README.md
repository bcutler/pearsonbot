PearsonBot
==========

A small data application that helps you visualize and test simple associations, usually stemming from survey data.


To pre-load it with fake data, run from the command line

	python; from contingency import init_db, test_data; init_db(); test_data()

To try the app, run

	python contingency.py

to run PearsonBot in a development setting.

And you'll have a small example.
